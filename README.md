# IPL-Data-Insights

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset. The project provides insights into team performance, player statistics, match outcomes, and trends using Python and popular data analysis libraries.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes IPL data to answer key questions such as:
- Which teams have the most wins?
- Who are the top-performing players?
- What are the trends in toss decisions and match outcomes?
- Is there a correlation between runs scored and wickets taken?
- Does home advantage play a significant role?

## Dataset
The analysis uses two datasets:
1. `matches.csv`: Summary information for each IPL match, including teams, winner, player of the match, toss decisions, and venue.
2. `deliveries.csv`: Ball-by-ball data for each match, including batting and bowling performances.

Both datasets were pre-processed and analyzed using Python.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and aggregation.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.

## Key Features
### Data Analysis
- **Team Performance:** Identified the number of wins and win percentages for each team.
- **Player Statistics:** Analyzed the most frequent "Player of the Match" awardees.
- **Runs Analysis:** Calculated average runs scored per match.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Examined the relationship between total runs scored and wickets taken in a match.
- **Home Advantage:** Determined the impact of playing at home on match outcomes.

### Data Visualization
- Bar plots for team wins, toss wins, and player awards.
- Histograms for run distributions.
- Scatter plots for correlations.

## Code Walkthrough
1. **Data Loading:**
   - `pandas.read_csv()` to load the `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv` datasets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - `groupby()` to aggregate data for teams and players.
   - `value_counts()` to analyze the frequency of wins and awards.
   - `corr()` to compute correlations between variables.
3. **Visualization:**
   - Used `seaborn` for creating bar charts.
   - Leveraged `matplotlib` for customizing visualizations.

## Results
- **Top Teams:** Identified teams with the highest win counts.
- **Player Excellence:** Highlighted the top 10 players with the most awards.
- **Toss Trends:** Visualized toss wins and decisions.
- **Runs-Wickets Correlation:** Found a moderate relationship between runs scored and wickets taken.
- **Home Advantage:** Quantified the number of matches won by home teams.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python ipl_data_analysis.py
   ```

## Visualizations
Below are examples of visualizations generated by the project:
- **Team Wins Bar Chart**
- **Top Players Awards Chart**
- **Toss Decisions Trend**

## Future Scope
- Expand the analysis to include batting and bowling strike rates.
- Integrate machine learning models for match outcome predictions.
- Create an interactive dashboard for real-time IPL data analysis.
